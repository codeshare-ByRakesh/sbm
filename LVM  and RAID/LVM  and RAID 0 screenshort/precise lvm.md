It seems like you're requesting a step-by-step explanation or need help breaking down each command individually. Let's go through the commands one by one:

1. **`apt update`**: 
   - Updates the package list to get information about the latest versions of packages available from the repositories.
   
2. **`apt install lvm2`**:
   - Installs the LVM (Logical Volume Manager) tools (`lvm2` package) to allow you to manage disk volumes.

3. **`lsblk`**: 
   - Lists the block devices on your system, showing all hard drives, partitions, and storage devices.

4. **`pvcreate /dev/sdb`**: 
   - Creates a physical volume (PV) on the `/dev/sdb` disk. This disk will now be part of your LVM setup.

5. **`pvdisplay`**: 
   - Displays detailed information about the physical volumes on your system.

6. **`pvcreate /dev/sdc`**: 
   - Creates another physical volume on the `/dev/sdc` disk, preparing it for use in LVM.

7. **`vgcreate suraj_volume_group /dev/sdb /dev/sdc`**: 
   - Creates a volume group (VG) named `suraj_volume_group` using `/dev/sdb` and `/dev/sdc` as physical volumes.

8. **`vgdisplay`**: 
   - Displays information about the volume group(s) on your system.

9. **`lvcreate`** (not listed explicitly, but inferred): 
   - A command used to create a logical volume (LV). It’s typically needed to create a logical volume within your volume group, but it's not in the history you’ve provided.

10. **`lvdisplay`**: 
    - Displays details about the logical volume(s) within the specified volume group.

11. **`mkfs.ext4 /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume`**: 
    - Formats the logical volume `suraj_logical_volume` in the ext4 filesystem.

12. **`blkid /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume`**: 
    - Shows detailed information about the logical volume, including its UUID and filesystem type.

13. **`mkdir /mnt/suraj_lvm`**: 
    - Creates a directory where the logical volume will be mounted.

14. **`mount /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume /mnt/suraj_lvm`**: 
    - Mounts the logical volume to the directory `/mnt/suraj_lvm`.

15. **`df -h`**: 
    - Displays disk space usage in a human-readable format, showing how much space is used and available on mounted filesystems.

16. **`mount | grep /mnt/suraj_lvm`**: 
    - Checks if the logical volume is mounted correctly by filtering the `mount` command output for `/mnt/suraj_lvm`.

17. **`nano /etc/fstab`**: 
    - Opens the `/etc/fstab` file for editing, where you can add a persistent entry for your logical volume to mount it automatically at boot.

18. **`lvextend -L 20G /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume`**: 
    - Extends the logical volume `suraj_logical_volume` to 20GB. (You mentioned in your history that it was later reduced to 15GB.)

19. **`lvextend -L 15G /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume`**: 
    - Reduces the previous extension and adjusts the logical volume size to 15GB.

20. **`resize2fs /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume`**: 
    - Resizes the filesystem on the logical volume to match the new size (15GB).

21. **`lvdisplay /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume`**: 
    - Displays the updated information of the logical volume after it was resized.

22. **`df -h`**: 
    - Checks again to see the updated disk space usage after resizing.

Add Data to the Mounted Volume
Now that the logical volume is mounted, you can store data on it. To do this, you can simply create some files or directories. For example:
bash
Copy code
mkdir /mnt/suraj_lvm/test_data
echo "This is some test data" > /mnt/suraj_lvm/test_data/file1.txt
This will create a directory test_data and a file file1.txt with some sample content.

3. Verify the Data
Verify that the data has been added to the logical volume by checking the contents of the directory:
bash
Copy code
ls /mnt/suraj_lvm/test_data
cat /mnt/suraj_lvm/test_data/file1.txt
You should see the file file1.txt and the contents you just added.

4. Check Logical Volume Status
Use the lvdisplay command to check the current size and usage of the logical volume:
bash
Copy code
lvdisplay /dev/suraj_volume_group/suraj_logical_volume
This will give you detailed information about the logical volume, including its size and any changes made.
